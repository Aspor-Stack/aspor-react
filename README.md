<br />

> Aspor is a comprehensive web stack for building fast, modern and reilable web applications (SPA / PWA). The concept is based on a decoupled architecture with an 
> independent OData interface running on an Asp .net service that is consumed by the React frontend application. 
> Backend services are seperated with a Microservice architecture and connected together with Aspor streaming.

## Project details
Aspor was originally developed to speed up the development of Asp.Net OData Api services. Aspor fills many gaps that I often encountered when I implemented new OData interfaces due to missing features or libraries (e.g. export, validation). In addition, Aspor should also assist with other subjects such as authorization and help calling the OData interface from a client application.

Aspor is still in its early days and any contribution would help to grow this project.

## Ecosystem

The project is divided into two main parts, each part can be used independently. 

* [.Net modules](https://github.com/Aspor-Stack/aspor)
* [React client](https://github.com/Aspor-Stack/aspor-react)
